    **COMPARE THIS TO THE EQUIVELENT PROMISE CODE IN 6-17**
    Sometimes, the steps that we have to go through to get to the final result don’t
    depend on each other, so we don’t have to make them in sequence. Instead, to save
    precious milliseconds, we can do them in parallel. For ex, if we want to set a
    plan in motion that requires us to know which ninjas we have at our disposal, the plan
    itself, and the location where our plan will play out, we could take advantage of
    jQuery’s get method and write something like the code below
    
    In this code, we execute the actions of getting the ninjas, getting the map info, and
    getting the plan in parallel, because these actions don’t depend on each other. We
    only care that, in the end, we have all the data at our disposal. Because we don’t know
    the order in which the data is received, every time we get some data, we have to check
    whether it’s the last piece of the puzzle that we’re missing. Finally, when all pieces are
    in place, we can set our plan in motion. Notice that we have to write a lot of boilerplate
    code just to do something as common as executing a number of actions in parallel.
